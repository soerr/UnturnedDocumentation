The **Commands.dat** file is key to setting up and customizing your Unturned server. It allows you to configure the server's map, name, slots, and other options. This guide provides a full list of commands for the **Commands.dat** file, along with descriptions of their functions and how to use them properly.

You'll find this file in the `Server/Commands.dat` directory of your server installation. For example, it might be located at:
```
Servers/unturned/Server/Commands.dat
```

All the commands in the **Commands.dat** are executed when the server starts before the map is loaded.

Some of them can be executed while the server is running for example **maxplayers**.
Below is a complete list of commands for your **Commands.dat** file, with descriptions of what they do and how to use them and examples.

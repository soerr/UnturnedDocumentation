### How to start?
In the next page you will learn how to set up Unturned server on your computer. This is the best way to start if you are new to hosting servers. You can play with your friends and learn how everything works and get your first hands-on experience.

After that I recommend getting a server from a third-party hosting provider. This way you can have your server online 24/7 and you can start building a community. 

Anyways, continue to the next page and let's get started!

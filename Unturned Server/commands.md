This is a list of vanilla player commands that can be used in-game on the server as an admin by typing them in the chat.

### Admin
The `admin` command is used to give a player admin blue hammer. Admin can use all commands and has access to all permissions.

**Syntax:** `/admin <player>`
- `<player>`: The name of the player to give admin to.

**Example:** `/admin MCrow`

### Unadmin
The `unadmin` command is used to remove admin blue hammer from a player.

**Syntax:** `/unadmin <player>`
- `<player>`: The name of the player to remove admin from.

> **💡 PRO TIP**  
> Unfortunately there is no way to remove admin from someone who is offline. If you want you can delete all admins.  
Stop the server and delete the `Adminlist.dat` file which you will find in the same directory as `Commands.dat`.

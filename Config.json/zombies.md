### Spawn_Chance
Percent chance (represented as a decimal) for any given zombie spawn node to spawn a zombie. Value must be within a range of **0.0** to **1.0**.

For example **0.2** means **20%** chance to spawn a zombie. Setting this value to **0.0** will prevent zombies from spawning.

Zombie spawn nodes on official maps:
- **PEI** - 1451
- **Washington** - 1137
- **Yukon** - 524
- **Russia** - 2458
- **Germany** - 1955

### Loot_Chance
Percent chance (represented as a decimal) for any given zombie to drop loot. Value must be within a range of **0.0** to **1.0**.

### Respawn_Day_Time

### Respawn_Night_Time
The time in seconds it takes for a zombie to respawn during the night.

### Respawn_Beacon_Time
The time in seconds it takes for a zombie to respawn during a horde beacon.

### Quest_Boss_Respawn_Interval
How many seconds it takes for a boss zombie spawned from a quest to attempt to spawn a new boss zombie. This setting is useful to prevent players from easily farming boss-tier loot. 

For example Kaiser Zombie Boss zombie from the quest on Germany map.

### Damage_Multiplier
Multiplier for the damage dealt by zombies. **0.75** means **75%** of the default damage.

The default damage of normal zombies on official maps is **15**, so with **0.75** multiplier the damage they deal is **11**.

### Armor_Multiplier
Multiplier for the armor of zombies when they are hit in the head. 

If you want to modify the armor of zombies when they are hit in other parts of the body, you can use the **NonHeadshot_Armor_Multiplier** setting.

The lower the value the less damage zombies take. 

For example setting this value to **0.5** will make zombies take **50%** less damage, so it's like they would have **200** HP instead of **100**, which is the default value on official maps.

### Backstab_Multiplier
Multiplier for the damage dealt by backstabbing zombies. Backstabbing is hitting a zombie in the back.

### NonHeadshot_Armor_Multiplier
Multiplier for the armor of zombies when they are not hit in the head.

### Beacon_Experience_Multiplier
Multiplier for the experience gained from killing zombies during a horde beacon.

### Full_Moon_Experience_Multiplier
Multiplier for the experience gained from killing zombies during a full moon night.

### Min_Drops
Minimum number of items dropped by a normal, crawler, sprinter, flanker, burner, acid, and spirit zombies.
